            <p> <strong>Jennifer Tran</strong>, here. I am a web developer in the bay area and a recent graduate from the Engineer Flex program at <strong>Thinkful.</strong> I enjoy
                coding since I get to see my creating and problem-solving skills come to life 
                in the form of an application or website. What enhances the fun in coding is working with a team of great programmers that can share their coding prowess. It is legitimately just like a group puzzle game.

            <br>

                Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking, meeting new people, and thrifting. I am 
                always striving to learn something new, every day. The tech industry is nothing, 
                but short of it.
